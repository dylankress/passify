A local-first, secure password manager built in Python that encrypts all user credentials using AES-GCM and stores them in a single encrypted vault file. SafeVault uses Argon2 for key derivation, ensures complete offline functionality, and is designed to replace browser-based password managers by prioritizing the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
